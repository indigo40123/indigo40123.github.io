		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p class="indent">
		Broadly speaking, I am interested in evaluating <i>phenomenon detectability arised from unsettled theories</i>, from high energy physics to radio astronomy. In physics, such fields are typically classified as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenomenology_(physics)" target="_blank">particle physics phenomenology</a>, which act as the bridge between theory and experiment. We studies the detection possibility of theoretical models predicted events, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">Dark Matter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_supernova_neutrino_background">Supernovae Relic Neutrino</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrimidine">Pyrimidine</a>. We propose the possbile observation strategies including the method to surpress the background noises based on monte-carlo simulation.
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		What is fascinating is that we are measuring the faintest signal in human history but with significant meanings. We join collboration teams and propose any possible signals that worth to discover. Once the scientific equippments reach the required sensitivity, we collaborate, analysis the experiment data and judge the fate of theories. 
		</p>
		<p class="indent">
		The amount of simulation and observational data used in these areas are <i>extremely large</i> and growing faster than ever before, and the analyses require advanced computer algorithms. Therefore, I am interested in the applications of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank">monte-carlo simulation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank">machine learning</a> and other algorithms to facilitate physics research.

		<h3>Observing Dark Matter with JUNO</h3>
		<p class="indent">
		As a grad student, I work on the <a href="http://juno.ihep.cas.cn/" target="_blank">JUNO</a> experiment located in Jiangmen, China with <a href="https://scholar.nctu.edu.tw/zh/persons/guey-lin-lin" target="_blank">Prof. Guey-Lin Lin</a>. JUNO is filled with 20ktons liquid scintillator and aim to capture the signal produced by neutrino. As one of the prestigious experiment site in the world, we evaluate the sensitivity for JUNO to detect the neutrino signal from the Dark Matter annihilation in our galaxy center. Imageine that <span style="text-decoration: overline">&#967</span> + &#967 -> <span style="text-decoration: overline">&#957</span><sub>e</sub> + &#957<sub>e</sub> (Dark Matter annihilate and produce neutrino) and <span style="text-decoration: overline">&#957</span><sub>e</sub> + p -> e<sup>+</sup> + n (Anti-electron neutrino interact with proton and produce positron and neutron). We are searching the final product, positron and neutron, which produced from Dark Matter. This two correlated product shows a specific features such as a certain distance difference, time difference and energy. However, some dominant backgrounds, such as atmospheric neutral current and cosmic muon induced fast neutron events can still mimic these feature. With the efficient background veto method such as Pulse shape analysis and fiducial volume cut, the backgounds events can be surppressed to about two order. Finally, we put a sentivity upperlimit in MeV Dark Matter search for JUNO detector.

		<h3>Search for Pyrimidine in Orion Kleinmann–Low Nebula</h3>
		<p class="indent">
		As a undergrad student, I analysis the <a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/" target="_blank">Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array(ALMA)</a> cycle-4 data set with <a href="https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv_c.php?i=kuan" target="_blank">Prof. Yi-Jehng Kuan</a>. We try to distinguish nine bandheads and five strong low‐J doublets for pyrimidine lines in the Orion KL hot molecular core. The difficulity for this project is the complexicity of Orion KL nebula. As the nearest high-mass star-forming environment, neurmous molecule lines appears here are also need to be identified in order to excluded the misidentification of target. Also, with the neurmous molecule lines, the precise continuum spectrum substraction becomes a difficult task. Our target, pyrimidine, which will easiliy be substracted during the data process flow if continuum spectrum is not estimated properly. As a result, we obtained some positive results after overcome these tasks. However, more carefully analysis and robustic test on dataset is still needed. Only after a full analysis of the ALMA data can be completed, a firm detection of interstellar pyrimidine can be established.
