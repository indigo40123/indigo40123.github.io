		<h2>Research</h2>
		<p class="indent">
		Broadly speaking, I am interested in detecting and evaluating the 
		rare astro signals, especially in particle physics. 

		<h3>DSNB search in SuperK</h3>
		I am currently focusing on the search for the Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background
		(DSNB), which consists of relic neutrinos produced by all supernova explosions in
		the universe. One of my PhD objectives is to reduce the uncertainty of DSNB’s 
		primary background—the atmospheric neutrino NCQE events—using the T2K
		neutrino beam. By measuring NCQE interactions more precisely, we can better
		estimate the background, thereby enhancing the DSNB search: with lower 
		background, fewer signal events are needed to claim a detection.
	    We also propose the possbile observation strategies including the method to surpress 
		the background noises based on monte-carlo simulation.
		</p>

		<p class="indent">
		What is fascinating is that we are measuring the faintest signal in human history 
		but with significant meanings. We join collboration teams and analysis the experiment data and provide the evidences 
		for unsettled theories.

		<h3>Observing Dark Matter with JUNO 
			(Publication : <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09567" target="_blank">
				JCAP 09 (2023) 001</a>)</h3>
		<p class="indent">
		As a grad student, I evaluated the phenomenon detectability arised from 
		unsettled theories. In physics, such fields are typically classified as particle 
		physics phenomenology, 	which act as the bridge between theory and experiment. 
		We studies the detection possibility of theoretical models predicted events, 
		Dark Matter, to be more specific. We propose the possbile observation strategies 
		including the method to surpress the background noises based on 
		monte-carlo simulation. I contributed an Collaboration paper for <a href="http://juno.ihep.cas.cn/" target="_blank">
		JUNO</a> Collaboration, which is a neutrino experiment located in Jiangmen, China 
		with my supervisor, <a href="https://scholar.nctu.edu.tw/zh/persons/guey-lin-lin" target="_blank">
		Prof. Guey-Lin Lin</a>. We evaluate the sensitivity for JUNO to detect the neutrino 
		signal from the Dark Matter annihilation in our galaxy center.

		<h3>Search for Pyrimidine in Orion Kleinmann–Low Nebula</h3>
		<p class="indent">
		As a undergrad student, I analysis the 
		<a href="https://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/" target="_blank">
			Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array(ALMA)</a> cycle-4 data set with 
			<a href="https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw/people/cv_c.php?i=kuan" target="_blank">Prof. Yi-Jehng Kuan</a>. 
			We try to distinguish nine bandheads and five strong low‐J doublets for pyrimidine lines 
			in the Orion KL hot molecular core. The difficulity for this project is the 
			complexicity of Orion KL nebula. As the nearest high-mass star-forming environment, 
			neurmous molecule lines appears here are also need to be identified in order 
			to excluded the misidentification of target. Also, with the neurmous molecule lines, 
			the precise continuum spectrum substraction becomes a difficult task. Our target, 
			pyrimidine, which will easiliy be substracted during the data process flow if continuum 
			spectrum is not estimated properly. As a result, we obtained some positive results 
			after overcome these tasks. However, more carefully analysis and robustic test on 
			dataset is still needed. Only after a full analysis of the ALMA data can be completed, 
			a firm detection of interstellar pyrimidine can be established.
